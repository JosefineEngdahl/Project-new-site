My first project! - ceating a magazine, I decided to go with an Art-theme.
## The problem

Since it's my first time coding I've been building and learning at the same time, some problems I've solved (google has been my best friend!) and some problems I haven't solved yet. I've been using both GRID, and flexbox and would love some feedback on my code since I guess I make it uncesessary complicated sometimes. 

1) My first problem was to understand when to use grid and when to use flexbox, I've been trying to figure this out by trial and error.

2) Second problem - understanding margins and how the layout changes depending on your CSS. I've been playing arund to solve my problems but I still have som issue with the CSS. For example: 1) Why does the button "all articles" have a "long" yellow background while the same yellow background is shorter on the other buttons (using the same CSS)? 2) I have all items in display "Block" still they land next to each other in some views (for example when trying the mobile-view 630px), why?

3) Third problem - writing "good code" when you're changing your layout throughout the work, for example H5 is in the header while H1-H4 is in the body, which doesn't make sense?

4) What's the smallest size you should build for? The layout doesn't look good when it's smaller than 325px, is that fine?

If I would have more time I would redo it just to understand it even better. I would also spend more time on the layout and "good coding", cause now I'm not sure if all my CSS is necessary.
